have simple http for more links with progressive enhancement websocket for just request relevant HTML, cuts down on page renders
but also have to recreate browser functionality, like passing cookies, handling cancelling/reloads, passing url parameters
take posts/comments from http into json
take upvotes from http into json
write value function for posts and comments, use EWMA
recentness shouldnt be linear, make it logarithmic maybe
also value shouldnt be linear
embedding links/media in posts/comments
previewing posts/comments
reddit doesnt have preview, but you can edit your comment
trending topics, on submit post/comment, add to EWMA
similar topics, on submit pos/comment, add to matrix of EWMA

database can be made efficient by precomputing everything as it comes in, so the search/sort only has to search a single index
the value of a post/comment is a function of votes (agrees), the values of replies, and another function of the length, number of links, "quality" metric
rate limit comments/posts/upvotes per user id
media backed by IPFS, text on server
use noembed for everything, maybe have to write/run a ipfs->oembed gateway for uploaded content
maybe tag link with [text, audio, video, image]
import link works like firefox readability, converts html to markdown, removes extra crap
includes link to original somewhere (top or bottom)
content that is embedded is favoured over content that links to external sites (by the value function)

cookie user_counter
cookie freshness
link get /[?after=0/20/40/60] use freshness
link get /post/.../#comment-id use freshness
form get /search/.../[&after=0/20/40/60] use freshness
form post /submit_post?text=... use user_counter
form post /submit_comment?post_id=...[&comment_id=...]&text=... use user_counter
form post /submit_upvote?post_id=...[&comment_id=...]
plain old http api, great for bots
easy command line integration

part of the encouragement to embed media is that [image/video/audio] will show up in the link title, attracting more users
count page views too
go linter
enshrine linking to social account
maybe append to comment by replying to self
embed media by default, dont allow changing link text, just shorten long links
self sustaining in terms of cost and moderation
efficient website, update everything on change, then a read is simple and fast, caching in the database
no surveillance, no google/facebook tracking or advertising
