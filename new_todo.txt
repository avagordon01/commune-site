only advantage of storm is that you can create multiple indexes which are correctly maintained easily

want a hierarchical bucket/key structure

want a function that takes a path and returns the value and all sub-values down to the next bucket

a key cannot hold both a bucket and a value

    can use a prefix search to get recursively
        while still being able to get posts quickly

no way to have autoincrementing IDs with a recursive structure that has data at each level
dont have autoincrementing IDs, so things might get fucked up

only get autoincrementing IDs if we have every level have buckets and only uint64 for IDs
no way to not have to access both "tables" without some duplication
