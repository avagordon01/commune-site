howto get a recursive structure in storm
want simplicity
have a root bucket containing posts
also have a 
could have a flat bucket of posts and comments
then have a separate tree like structure for storing ids

no need to separate them because in storm the indexes are separate from the bucket structure?
like we could have a recursive bucket structure and still OrderBy("Freshness*") quickly?
